# Activation Privacy Statement

This article outlines the steps needed to perform SPDocKit activation.

### Farm License

Farm license is tied to a __Farm ID__ and thus, can be activated only on servers with SharePoint installed. This also means that you can activate a single farm license on all servers in one SharePoint farm.

1. From the left navigation bar on the __Backstage Screen__ select __Help__ and click on __License Details__ section to begin the activation process.
2. On the activation screen choose __Farm or Site__ option.
3. Fill in the __Company__ and __Product Key__ fields.

The product key is a combination of letters and numbers. In order to claim your activation key, please log in to our [customers portal](https://customers.acceleratio.net/). There you will be able to track your orders and download the latest application versions you are entitled to. When a major upgrade becomes available, all customers with a valid software assurance will have their profile refreshed with new version download link and a brand new activation key.

Once you have entered the product key it will be validated against our activation server. If your key is valid, a green check mark will appear next to it.

4. Click the __Activate__ button to start the activation process.  Activation lasts for a couple of seconds and it is a one time process.

### Consultant License

Consultant license can be activated on any server, but you need to have a valid SPDocKit consultant subscription. Please take special care that Consultant license is intended for external (customers farm) usage only. Here is how to activate a consultant license.

1. From the left navigation bar on __Backstage Screen__ select __Help__ and click on marked section.
2. On the activation screen choose __Consultant__ option. Fill in the __Email__ and __Password__ fields.

You need to use the same email and password that you received during your online purchase. [Contact us](https://www.spdockit.com/support/contact-us/) if you do not have the activation information.

__One-time activation__ option allows you short-term activation of the SPDocKit. If you check in this box, when you finish using the application and close it, license details are deleted and product will no longer be activated. This feature can be quite convenient when you are documenting your customers SharePoint.

3. Click the __Activate__ button to start the activation process. Activation lasts for a couple of seconds and it needs to be repeated on every server you choose to activate. You can activate your license on the unlimited number of customers servers while your subscription is active.

__Please note!__ Consultant license requires re-activation every 30 days. When your current Consultant subscription expires SPDocKit will warn you that re-activation is needed in case you renewed it.

### Site License

Site license is tied to a __domain name__, __workstation ID__ or __farmID__, which means you can use it to activate the unlimited number of SharePoint farms and workstations/computers within one physical location.
