### Farm License

The Farm license is tied to a __farm ID__ and can be activated only on servers with SharePoint installed. This also means that you can activate a single Farm license on all servers in one SharePoint farm.

1. From the left navigation bar on the __Backstage Screen__ select __Help__ and click on the __License Details__ section to begin the activation process.
2. On the activation screen choose the __Farm or Site__ option.
3. Fill in the __Company__ and __Product Key__ fields.

    The product key is a combination of letters and numbers. In order to claim your activation key, please log in to our [customers portal](https://customers.acceleratio.net/). There you will be able to track your orders and download the latest application versions you are entitled to. When a major upgrade becomes available, all customers with a valid software assurance will have their profile refreshed with new version download link and a brand new activation key.

    Once you have entered the product key it will be validated against our activation server. If your key is valid, a green check mark will appear next to it.

4. Click the __Activate__ button to start the activation process. Activation takes a couple of seconds and is a one time process.

### Consultant License

The Consultant license can be activated on any server, but you need to have a valid SPDocKit Consultant subscription. Please take special care that the Consultant license is intended for external (customers' farms) usage only. Here is how to activate a Consultant license online.

1. From the left navigation bar on the __Backstage Screen__, select __Help__ and click on the __License Details__ section to begin the activation process.
2. On the activation screen choose the __Consultant__ option. Fill in the __Email__ and __Password__ fields.

    You need to use the same email and password that you received during your online purchase. [Contact us](https://www.spdockit.com/support/contact-us/) if you do not have the activation information.

    The __One-time activation__ option allows short-term activation of SPDocKit. If you check this box, the license details will be deleted and the license will be deactivated when the application is closed. This feature can be quite convenient when you are documenting your customer's SharePoint.

3. Click the __Activate__ button to start the activation process. Activation takes a couple of seconds and it needs to be repeated on every server you choose to activate. You can activate your license on an unlimited number of customers' servers while your subscription is active.

__Please note!__ The Consultant license requires re-activation every 30 days. When your current Consultant subscription expires, SPDocKit will warn you that re-activation is needed.

### Site License

The Site license is tied to a __domain name__, __workstation ID__ or __farm ID__, which means you can use it to activate SPDocKit on an unlimited number of SharePoint farms and workstations/computers within one physical location.

1. From the left navigation bar on the __Backstage Screen__ select __Help__ and click on the __License Details__ section to begin the activation process.
2. On the activation screen choose the __Farm or Site__ option.
3. Fill in the __Company__ and __Product Key__ fields.

    The product key is a combination of letters and numbers. In order to claim your activation key, please log in to our [customers portal](https://customers.acceleratio.net/). There you will be able to track your orders and download the latest application versions that you are entitled to. When a major upgrade becomes available, all customers with a valid software assurance will have their profile refreshed with a new version download link and a brand new activation key.

    Once you have entered the product key it will be validated against our activation server. If your key is valid, a green check mark will appear next to it.

4. Click the __Activate__ button to start the activation process. Activation takes a couple of seconds and it is a one time process.

### Workstation License or SPDocKit Online License

The Workstation license is tied to the __workstation ID__ and cannot be used on a SharePoint server. It is intended for people who would like to explore SPDocKit reports, manage permissions directly from their computers or do not have the direct access to SharePoint servers.

1. From the left navigation bar on the __Backstage Screen__ select __Help__ and click on the __License Details__ section to begin the activation process.
2. On the activation screen choose the __Workstation/Site/Online__ option.
3. Fill in the __Company__ and __Product Key__ fields.

    The product key is a combination of letters and numbers. In order to claim your activation key, please log in to our [customers portal](https://customers.acceleratio.net/). There you will be able to track your orders and download the latest application versions you are entitled to. When a major upgrade becomes available, all customers with a valid software assurance will have their profile refreshed with new version download link and a brand new activation key.
