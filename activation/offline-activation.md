### Farm license

The Farm license is tied to a __farm ID__ and can be activated only on servers with SharePoint installed.

1. From the left navigation bar on the __Backstage Screen__ select __Help__ and click on the __License Details__ section to begin the activation process.
2. Click on the __Offline Activation__ link and a new activation dialog will appear. Follow these steps:
    * Click on the __Generate__ button to generate a __License Details (.dlic) file__.
    * Navigate to the [Activation Page](https://my.syskit.com/activation/?P=SPDocKit) and select __Farm__ activation option.
    * Select the __Version__ of SPDocKit you are creating a license for.
    * On the Activation Page paste the __Product key__, which you can find in our [customers portal](https://my.syskit.com).
