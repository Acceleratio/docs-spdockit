   * Select the **Version** of SPDocKit you are creating a license for.
   * On the Activation Page, login with your username and password. You need to use the same email and password that you received during your online purchase. [Contact us](https://www.spdockit.com/support/contact-us/) if you do not have the activation information.

The **One-time activation** option allows short-term activation of SPDocKit. If you check this box, the license details will be deleted and the license will be deactivated when the application is closed. This feature can be quite convenient when you are documenting your customer's SharePoint.

**Please note!** The Consultant license file is valid for 72 hours from the time of generation.
