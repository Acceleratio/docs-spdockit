# Offline Activation

This article outlines the steps needed to perform an offline SPDocKit activation. Use this type of activation in case your SharePoint servers are not connected to the internet.

### Farm License

2. Click on the __Offline Activation__ link and new activation dialog will appear. Follow these steps:
