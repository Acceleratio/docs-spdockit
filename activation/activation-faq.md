### What happens during product activation?

Product activation is a simple process that occurs during registration of the purchased product. The product key is entered and then authenticated with the Acceleratio Ltd. product activation server in order to activate the product. The entire activation process is quick and easy, and the majority of users will have to perform product activation only once.

### Who will be required to activate their products?

Anyone who purchases SPDocKit will be required to activate the product. If the product is ordered online from the Acceleratio Ltd. website, the product activation code will be sent via email.

### How soon must I activate my product?

It is recommended you activate your product within the 30 days of the trial period. After the period expires, the application will stop working until it is activated.

### What happens if I do not activate my product?

If you do not activate your product within the 30-day trial period, it will stop working until you activate it.

### If I do not have a product activation code to activate my software, how can I get a product activation code?

If you cannot find your product activation code, you should send a support request to [support team](https://www.spdockit.com/support/contact-us/).

### How do I activate my product?

You can activate your product 24 hours a day, seven days a week on the Internet. Product activation requires you to type in your product activation code and press activate. You must have an active connection to the Internet in order to activate your product.

### What does Acceleratio Ltd. do with the information sent during the product activation process?

We use the information only to verify that your product is used within the scope allowed by the Acceleratio Ltd. End-User License Agreement (EULA). The information is stored in a database and used only for product activation data. If you register your product, none of the activation information will ever be linked to your personal customer information.

### What is product activation?

Product activation is an anonymous, secure and hassle-free process that authenticates licensed users during the installation process. The process verifies that the product activation code is genuine and has not been activated on more systems than allowed by the Acceleratio Ltd. End-User License Agreement (EULA).

### Why does Acceleratio Ltd. require their customers to activate the software?

Product activation is a simple way to reduce and deter unauthorized use and casual copying of Acceleratio Ltd. products with a minimal effect on our loyal customers.

### Will the activation process ever send data to Acceleratio Ltd. after I activate my product?

No. Activation is a secure and anonymous one-time process. After activation is complete, the license manager runs alongside the product for the sole purpose of verifying the integrity of the license file and the validity of the product license. The activation technology in the product does not send any additional information to Acceleratio Ltd.

### How long does the product activation take to complete?

Product activation is a one-time process that is typically completed immediately after installation of the software. Activation typically takes 2-5 seconds to complete.

### When is product reactivation required?

Product reactivation is required only under exceptional circumstances – if, for example, you upgrade or replace your server, or if the activation process detects that the license has been tampered with.

### What if I have more than one server? Does the new license allow me to use the software on multiple servers?

One SPDocKit farm license can be activated on all servers within the same SharePoint farm. If you want to use SPDocKit for multiple SharePoint farms, you will need to purchase an additional farm license for every farm you wish to document.

### What are the Consultant license restrictions?

There are several restrictions in the Consultant edition:
* Consultant License Call Home – once activated on a SharePoint server or on a workstation, the Consultant license has to be re-activated every 30 days.
* The license file generated for the offline activation is only valid for 72 hours. If you try to activate SPDocKit with a license file generated more than 72 hours ago, the activation process will fail.
* SPDocKit Service is not available with the Consultant license. This also means that the following features are unavailable due to this restriction:
    * Automatic Queries and Rules*
    * Automatic Snapshots*
    * Automatic Data Retention*
    * Automatic Email Subscriptions*
    * Performance Monitoring
    * Event Viewer Alerts

*These actions can still be manually executed.

### What are the trial limitations?

The trial version of SPDocKit has a couple of limitations:
* Limited information in the generated documentation and exported reports. Export to .docx or .xlsx formats is not available. You can see examples of how exported [reports](https://www.spdockit.com/resources/reports/) and [documentation](https://www.spdockit.com/resources/documentation-examples/) look like in the full version.
* Best Practices reports are limited to the dashboard overview.
* Permissions management is limited to 20 actions.
* The comparison feature is completely functional when comparing the same farm
    * Comparison of different farms with snapshots made with the trial software is not possible.

If you would like to see more about the limited features, [contact us](https://www.spdockit.com/support/contact-us/) and we will be more than happy to organize a demo for you and your colleagues to show SPDocKit at its full strength.
