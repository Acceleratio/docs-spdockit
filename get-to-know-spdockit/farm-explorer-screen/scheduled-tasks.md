In SPDocKit version 5, the feature is listed as a separate section under the Farm Explorer. To see the feature in version 6 onward, select a snapshot you wish to view. Navigate from the Farm Explorer down to Scheduled Tasks, and click the View ribbon.

With the Scheduled Tasks report, SharePoint administrators can more easily visualize important scheduled jobs across the SharePoint farm. This viewer offers the following tasks:

* Crawl schedule overview (full and incremental crawl schedules)
* User profile synchronization
* Audiences compilation
* Content deployment schedules

Jobs will be displayed in a calendar-like format, making these jobs easy to schedule on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis.
