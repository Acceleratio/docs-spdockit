The __Site Explorer__ allows system administrators to explore SharePoint's Web applications, site collections, and subsites, both live and previously loaded. Use the tree view in the left navigation bar to expand and collapse sections and to preview values in the main grid.

Available reports per __Web Application__ are:
* Web Application Features
* People Picker Settings
* Web Config Files

Available reports per __Site Collection__ are:
* Site Collection Features
* Solutions
* Content Types Hierarchy

Available reports per __Subsite__ are:
