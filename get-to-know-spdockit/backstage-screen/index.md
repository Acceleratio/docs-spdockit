The Backstage Actions view is a set of commands that can be used to quickly approach major SPDocKit options.

The following options are available:

* __Take Snapshot__ button loads SharePoint farm data if an on-premises farm is detected. This option is only available on SharePoint servers.
* __View Snapshots__ button will take you to all your saved snapshots, and you can select any of them to open and view data.
* __Compare Wizard__ button starts the compare wizard that allows you to compare farms, Web applications, site collections, web config files and permissions.
* __Options__ button gives you access to configuration options for adjusting SPDocKit to your needs.
* __Permissions Explorer__ leads you directly to SharePoint permissions, both live and historical records, collected by SPDocKit.
* __Permission Wizards__ button gives you quick access to all permissions management options available. 
* Use the __Queries and Rules__ button to open and create desired procedures or reports to enforce your SharePoint Governance policies.
* __Insights__ button runs the __SysKit Insights__ application if installed on the machine.
