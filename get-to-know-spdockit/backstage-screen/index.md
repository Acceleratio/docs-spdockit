The Backstage Actions view is a set of commands that can be used to quickly approach major SPDocKit options.

The following options are available:

* **Take Snapshot** button loads SharePoint farm data if an on-premises farm is detected, otherwise connects to and loads data from a connected on-premises farm or an Office 365 tenant.
* **View Snapshots** button will take you to all your saved snapshots, and you can select any of them to open and view data.
* **Compare Wizard** button starts the compare wizard that allows you to compare farms, Web applications, site collections, web config files and permissions.
* **Options** button gives you access to configuration options for adjusting SPDocKit to your needs.
* **Permissions Explorer** leads you directly to SharePoint permissions, both live and historical records, collected by SPDocKit.
* **SharePoint Online** button leads you to your SharePoint Online sites that are currently available on the Live Permissions Explorer.
* **Permission Wizards** button gives you quick access to all permissions management options available. 
* Use the **Queries and Rules** button to open and create desired procedures or reports to enforce your SharePoint Governance policies.

The **Insights** buttons interact directly with the SPDocKit Insights application.
