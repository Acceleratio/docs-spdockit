title: Role Based Security
---
This advanced security feature is meant to help admins take control and to allow them to define different SPDocKit access levels. Users and groups can be assigned to specific roles based on elements of SPDocKit or on SharePoint site collection permissions.

## How to set up Role Based Security

To enable this feature, navigate to the Backstage Configuration Screen, click Role-Based Security, and then select the Enable role-based security check box. Click Save to store your settings.

Please note that the user who enables this feature, will automatically be assigned the Admin role. For Role-Based Security to work, you have to use a database and have the db_owner permissions.
