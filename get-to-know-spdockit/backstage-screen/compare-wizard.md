# Compare Wizard

Compare Wizard provides the possibility to track farm configuration changes and compare specific SharePoint elements. With a couple of easy steps you can view the desired differences and export the result.

* [Compare Farms](https://github.com/SysKitTeam/docs-spdockit/tree/8b06dc9182659a72e14285486dc7b3af590ff348/get-to-know-spdockit/how-to/compare-wizard/compare-sharepoint-farms.md) – compare farm settings from stored in a snapshot to SharePoint's default settings, or compare two saved snapshots - with various mapping and ignore options, you can easily compare different farms.
* [Compare Servers](https://github.com/SysKitTeam/docs-spdockit/tree/8b06dc9182659a72e14285486dc7b3af590ff348/get-to-know-spdockit/how-to/compare-wizard/compare-servers.md) – compare differences between two servers in your farm or track the changes that were made to a server over time.
