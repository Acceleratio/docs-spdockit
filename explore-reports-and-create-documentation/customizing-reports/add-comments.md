This section describes how to add comments to Reports and individual Snapshots.

## __Comments__ 

To distinguish and describe existing Snapshots and Farm Explorer Reports, you can use the __Comment__ feature available from SPDocKit 7.3 onwards.

To start working with comments, in the __Snapshots__ section navigate to the __Comments__ ribbon in the top menu under the __Data__ category and select the __Show__ button. The same action can be done in the __Farm Explorer__ section when any of the Farm Explorer reports, which support comments, is opened.  

A new panel appears on the right side of the window with the __Comments__ tab opened and shows all of the comments created for the currently opened report. 
Also, a new column appears on the left side of the Farm Explorer Report/Snapshots grid with the speech bubble icon displayed for the rows which have comments.

To add a comment to the selected Snapshot or Farm Explorer Report row, select the __Add__ button in the top menu's __Comments__ ribbon.
You can also add a comment by clicking the beforementioned first column field.
Notice the speech bubble icon and the tooltip appearing when you hover the mouse over the first column of the Farm Explorer Report grid or Snapshots grid.

The top menu's __Comments__ ribbon enables you to easily __Add__, __Edit__, and __Delete__ comments. The same options are available in the contextual menu that appears when you right-click a row.

To view all comments you have created, navigate to the top menu's __Comments__ ribbon and select the __Go to Report__ option. The __All Comments__ report opens with the columns __Author__, __Comment__, and __Last Modified__ displayed and grouped by __Path__. When you double-click a comment from the grid, associated Farm Explorer Report or Snapshot to which the comment belongs is displayed. The same action can also be done by clicking the __Go to Comment__ button in the top menu __Comments__ ribbon.  

The __All Comments__ report can easily be exported by selecting the __Export__ option from the __Home__ ribbon in the top menu.

To include your comments in the generated documentation navigate to the __Backstage__ and select __Options__ on the __Configuration__ screen. Under __Report Options__ check the __Include comments in documentation__ option. Your comments will now be visible in the generated documentation.
