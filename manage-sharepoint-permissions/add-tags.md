This section describes how to add tags to Securable Objects.

## __Tags__

In the Permissions Explorer, you can find another useful feature - adding tags to Securable Objects.

Tags can be added Live but also when exploring previously created snapshots.

To add a tag navigate to the top menu's __Tags__ ribbon under the __Data__ category. Select your target - Securable Object - in the __Permissions Explorer__, and select the __Add Tag__ button. In the same ribbon, you can also find the __Delete Tag__ button to remove a tag from the selected Object. 

__Add Tag__ and __Delete Tag__ options are also available in the context menu which appears if you right-click a Securable Object in the tree view.

To view all created tags navigate to __Snapshots__ section and select the __Tagged Objects__ report. 
Information about all tagged objects is displayed in the __Object__, __Object Type__ and __Object Url__ columns which, by default, are grouped by __Tag__.  The __Tagged Objects__ report can also be accessed directly from the __Permissions Explorer__ by selecting the __Go to Report__ option in the top menu's __Tags__ ribbon. 

The __Tagged Objects__ report can easily be exported by selecting the __Export__ option from the __Home__ ribbon in the top menu.

Each of the tagged objects can easily be accessed by selecting the appropriate row in the __Tagged Objects__ report and clicking the __Go to Object__ button in the top menu __Tags__ ribbon.

Another upside of using the tag feature is the possibility to __search the Securable Objects by tags__. In the __Permissions Explorer__ simply type the tag name into the __Search__ text field. All Securable Objects tagged with the inputted text are displayed in a dropdown list. When you select a single object from the list, the object also becomes selected in the tree view and the permissions are displayed in the grid.
