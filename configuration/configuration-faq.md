### Can I customize the account for the service that will be running and creating snapshots?

Yes, you can do that via the SPDocKit Configuration Wizard by navigating to: __File > Configuration > Configure__.

### During the initial install of SPDocKit, should I choose New database or Use existing database?
Do not use your SharePoint databases as the database for SPDocKit. When configuring SPDocKit, you should always create a new database that is dedicated for SPDocKit.

Note: If there is an existing SPDocKit database you can connect to it.
