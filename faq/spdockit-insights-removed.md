This article explains why SPDocKit Insights is no longer a part of SPDocKit, where to find new licenses for the new SysKit Insights, and which existing data can be reused in the new application.

First of all, let us answer the question why SPDocKit Insights is no longer a part of SPDocKit. The answer is quite simple - a new and improved option is available – __[SysKit Insights](https://www.syskit.com/products/insights/)__. __SysKit Insights__ is a new, standalone solution designed for the monitoring of your SharePoint farms. Think of it as an upgraded version of SPDocKit Insights that comes with a __range of improvements and new features.__ 

All existing customers eligible for the upgrade to SysKit Insights can find their new product keys on our [customers portal](https://my.syskit.com). To find more information about upgrade paths and licensing changes that come with the version 8 of SPDocKit, read [this blog](https://blog.syskit.com/spdockit-v8-licensing-changes).

With the removal of SPDocKit Insights, not everything is lost. Although SysKit Insights needs a dedicated database, you can retain your event data stored in the index, as well as the farms you monitored in SPDocKit Insights.
