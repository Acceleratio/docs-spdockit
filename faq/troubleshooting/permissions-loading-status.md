# Why is my permissions loading status being reported as ”Failed”?

## Problem:
When I am trying to load my SharePoint farm permissions, loading wizard informs me that loading status is Failed for some of the objects.

## Solution
Make sure that the user account running SPDocKit has the proper [permission privileges](#internal/requirements/user-permissions-requirements) for the SharePoint farm for which you are trying to load the permissions.

Check the event log for the SPDocKit related entries and [contact us](https://www.spdockit.com/support/contact-us/).
