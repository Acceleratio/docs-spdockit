__Summary:__ The problem occurs when the SharePoint Groups report is containing recursive groups and is exported or generated with a subscription. The resulting document comes with a couple of errors when trying to display recursive group members - unnecessary whitespace is shown between columns, the height of some rows is increased and the group icons are displaced.

__Solution:__ Currently there is no workaround for this issue.

__Status:__ Not resolved.
