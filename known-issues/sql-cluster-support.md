title: SQL Clusters Support
description: This article describes the problem with information about SQL clusters missing inside SPDocKit documentation.
---

__Summary:__ Information about SQL clusters is missing inside SPDocKit documentation. If your farm databases are using any high-availability solutions like database mirroring or AlwaysOn groups, SPDocKit will not include those details in the documentation. Only the SQL server where the primary database is located will be shown by SPDocKit.

__Application Version:__ 3.0.0 and newer

__Solution:__ Currently there is no workaround for this issue.

__Status:__ Not resolved.
