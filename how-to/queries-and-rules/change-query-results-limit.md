This section describes how to change the limit on query results in SPDocKit.

By default, query results are limited to 1,000 query results per site collection. However, if your query produces more than 1,000 results and you wish to see all of them, you can change this limit in the SPDocKit Options. Please note that changing the limit to a higher number also means the time needed for SPDocKit to execute your query will be increased.

1. Navigate to the Backstage Configuration Screen and click __Options__.
1. Go to __General__ options and edit the value in the __Maximum number of query results per site collection__ field. Click Save to save your changes.
