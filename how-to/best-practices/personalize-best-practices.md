# Personalize Best Practices


### Create a new Best Practices report

The first option is to create a completely new Best Practices report using the Best Practices wizard.
The second option is to save the built-in Best Practices report as a new one and then modify some of the settings so that this report will better match your SharePoint settings. Use the __Save As__ button to save the desired report under a different name and then the __Edit__ button to configure new settings.

### Adjust the Best Practices dashboard view
Click __Customize Best Practices__ on the Best Practices Home ribbon. Deselect the check boxes for the reports you donâ€™t want to monitor. Click Save to finish adjusting your dashboard view.

### Customize the built-in Best Practices values
Best Practices reports checking some numerical values, like the amount of RAM per server, can be customized as well. Click on the Best Practices report you would like to modify and edit the numerical values on the right to fit your requirements. Please note that if you edit these values, the Best Practice report will display a warning that the default values have been changed.
