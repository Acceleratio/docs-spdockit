This section describes how you can generate SharePoint farm documentation using SPDocKit.

1. Use the __Take Snapshot__ button to load local SharePoint farm settings, or choose to Open existing farm snapshot. You can view all of your snapshots if you navigate to the __Backstage Actions Screen__ and click the __View Snapshots__ button or if you go directly to the Snapshots tab.

1. Click __Generate__ from the left-side navigation pane and select the format in which you wish to create your farm documentation. The available formats are __.doc, .pdf and .xlsx__.

1. The farm settings you want to export can be selected from the drop-down options.

    The selection you make can be saved and used as a template for generating documentation in the future. SPDocKit comes with predefined documentation templates, with commonly used options already pre-selected. 

   The documentation templates available by default are: __All, Full Documentation (Without Site Explorer) Regular Documentation or Simple Documentation.__ Use the Up and Down arrows to rearrange the order of your documentation.

   There is a possibility that there will be a large amount of data contained in Site Explorer reports, so we added a template called __Full Documentation without Site Explorer__. If you want to export all Site Explorer information, please note that the active snapshot will need to be saved in the SPDocKit database.

1. The __Document Outline__ tab displays how the table of contents of your document will look.

1.  With the Options tab you can choose whether [Passwords and Product Keys](#internal/get-to-know-spdockit/farm-explorer-screen/passwords-and-product-keys)  will be displayed in the generated document. If these were not defined, the checkbox will be disabled.

1. Click the __Generate__ button, wait a few moments and your SharePoint farm documentation will be generated!
