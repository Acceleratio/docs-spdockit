# Create Farm Documentation

This section describes how you can generate SharePoint farm documentation using SPDocKit.

1. Use the **Take Snapshot** button to load local SharePoint farm settings, or choose to Open existing farm snapshot. You can view all of your snapshots if you navigate to the **Backstage Actions Screen** and click the **View Snapshots** button or if you go directly to the Snapshots tab.
2. Click **Generate** from the left-side navigation pane and select the format in which you wish to create your farm documentation. The available formats are **.doc, .pdf and .xlsx**.
3. The farm settings you want to export can be selected from the drop-down options.

   The selection you make can be saved and used as a template for generating documentation in the future. SPDocKit comes with predefined documentation templates, with commonly used options already pre-selected.

   The documentation templates available by default are: **All, Full Documentation \(Without Site Explorer\) Regular Documentation or Simple Documentation.** Use the Up and Down arrows to rearrange the order of your documentation.

   There is a possibility that there will be a large amount of data contained in Site Explorer reports, so we added a template called **Full Documentation without Site Explorer**. If you want to export all Site Explorer information, please note that the active snapshot will need to be saved in the SPDocKit database.

4. The **Document Outline** tab displays how the table of contents of your document will look.
5. With the Options tab you can choose whether [Passwords and Product Keys](create-farm-documentation.md#internal/get-to-know-spdockit/farm-explorer-screen/passwords-and-product-keys) will be displayed in the generated document. If these were not defined, the check box will be disabled.
6. Click the **Generate** button, wait a few moments and your SharePoint farm documentation will be generated!
