This section describes how to add comments and tags to Reports and individual Snapshots.

### **Comments** 

To distinguish and describe existing Snapshots and Farm Explorer Reports, you can use the **Comment** feature available from SPDocKit 7.3. onwards.

To start working with comments, navigate to the **Comments tab** in the top menu and select the **Show button**. 

A new panel appears on the right side of the window with the **Comments tab** opened. 
The **Comments tab** shows all comments created for the selected Farm Explorer Report or the Snapshots in case the **Snapshots section** is selected.
Also, a new column appears left to the Farm Explorer Report/Snapshots grid with the speech bubble icon displayed for the items which have been commented.

To add a comment to the selected Snapshot or Farm Explorer Report row, select the **Add button** in the top menu's **Comments tab**.
You can also add a comment by selecting the beforementioned first column field.
Notice the speech bubble icon and the tooltip appearing when you hover the mouse over the first column of the Farm Explorer Report grid or Snapshots grid.

The top menu's **Comments tab** enables you to easily **Add**, **Edit**, and **Delete** comments. The same options are available in the contextual menu that appears when you right-click the first column of the Farm Explorer Report or Snapshots grid. 

To view all comments you have created, navigate to the top menu's **Comments tab** an select the **All** option. Comments overview grid opens with the columns **Author**, **Comment**, and **Last Modified** visible and grouped by **Path**. When you double-click a comment from the grid, associated Farm Explorer Report or Snapshot to which the comment belongs is displayed.  

To include your comments in the generated documentation navigate to the **Backstage Configuration Screen** and select **Options**. Under **Report Options** check the **Include comments in Documentation** option. Your comments will now be visible in the generated documentation. 

### **Tags**

In the Permissions Explorer, you can find another useful feature - adding tags to Securable Objects.

Tags can be added Live but also in all created Snapshots.

To add a tag navigate to the top menu's **Tags** tab, select your target Securable Object in the **Permissions Explorer** and select the **Add Tag** button. In the same tab, you can also find the **Delete Tag** button to remove the tag from the selected Object.
