This section describes how to add comments and tags to Reports and individual Snapshots.

### __Comments__ 

To distinguish and describe existing Snapshots and Farm Explorer Reports, you can use the __Comment__ feature available from SPDocKit 7.3 onwards.

To start working with comments, navigate to the __Comments__ tab in the top menu and select the __Show__ button. 

A new panel appears on the right side of the window with the __Comments__ tab opened. 
The __Comments__ tab shows all comments created for the selected Farm Explorer Report or the Snapshots in case the __Snapshots__ section is selected.
Also, a new column appears left to the Farm Explorer Report/Snapshots grid with the speech bubble icon displayed for the items which have been commented.

To add a comment to the selected Snapshot or Farm Explorer Report row, select the __Add__ button in the top menu's __Comments__ tab.
You can also add a comment by selecting the beforementioned first column field.
Notice the speech bubble icon and the tooltip appearing when you hover the mouse over the first column of the Farm Explorer Report grid or Snapshots grid.

The top menu's __Comments__ tab enables you to easily __Add__, __Edit__, and __Delete__ comments. The same options are available in the contextual menu that appears when you right-click the first column of the Farm Explorer Report or Snapshots grid. 

To view all comments you have created, navigate to the top menu's __Comments__ tab an select the __All__ option. Comments overview grid opens with the columns __Author__, __Comment__, and __Last Modified__ visible and grouped by __Path__. When you double-click a comment from the grid, associated Farm Explorer Report or Snapshot to which the comment belongs is displayed.  

To include your comments in the generated documentation navigate to the __Backstage Configuration Screen__ and select __Options__. Under __Report Options__ check the __Include comments in Documentation__ option. Your comments will now be visible in the generated documentation. 

### __Tags__

In the Permissions Explorer, you can find another useful feature - adding tags to Securable Objects.

Tags can be added Live but also in all created Snapshots.

To add a tag navigate to the top menu's __Tags__ tab, select your target Securable Object in the __Permissions Explorer__ and select the __Add Tag__ button. In the same tab, you can also find the __Delete Tag__ button to remove the tag from a selected Object. 

To view all created tags navigate to __Snapshots__ section and select the __Tagged Objects__ overview. 
Information about the tagged objects is displayed in the __Object__, __Object Type__ and __Object Url__ columns and by default grouped by __Tag__.
