This section explains how to add principals and manage users.

1. Navigate to the **Backstage Configuration Screen**, and click **Manage Users**.
2. To add a new user, click **Add Users**.  
   Enter user names or search to add them as principals and assign them a certain role. Click **Assign** to finish and save your changes.
3. To edit or delete a user use the corresponding buttons in the toolbar.  
   **Please note!** For convenience we provide an option to delete the SQL login of the selected user as part of deleting the user from the SPDocKit database.  
   If the selected user is using a database other than the SPDocKit on a given server, you shouldnâ€™t try to delete its SQL login. However, if the SPDocKit database is the only one the selected user is using, you can completely remove his or her logon rights.
