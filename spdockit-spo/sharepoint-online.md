SPDocKit 7 brings extended SharePoint Online support. Apart from the live explorer we had from previous versions, you can now take snapshots of your SharePoint online environment and use it later to view all permission reports historically.

Please check the [feature availability by license type](https://www.spdockit.com/orders/features-by-licenses/).

In order to fully exhaust all available features:
1. Connect to a SharePoint Online site(s).
2. Use Permission Explorer to easily navigate through SharePoint Online permissions by selecting a scurable object you are interested in.
3. Take Snapshot of your SharePoint Online environment to explore available SPDocKit Permissions Reports.

Apart from numerous permissions report that can help you understand SharePoint Online site structure, permissions inheritance, granted permissions for a specific securable object and principal permissions, you can:
* check [externally shared content](#internal/get-to-know-spdockit/permissions-reports-screen) and who are the users it is shared with
* use SPDocKit [permissions management actions](#internal/permissions-management) to stay compliant with your governance strategy and to keep permissions under control
* track permissions changes in your environment using [Permissions Compare](#internal/how-to/compare-wizard/compare-sharepoint-permissions) wizard
* [restore SharePoint Online permissions](#internal/permissions-management/restore-permissions) to a previously recored state  


Please note! Some of the SPDocKit reports will not be available for the SharePoint Online environment:
* Content & Usage Reports (only Site Structure report is fully functional)
* Best Practices Reports
* Adminstrative Actions Report
* Security Audit Report
* Cleanup Reports and Cleanup Wizard
