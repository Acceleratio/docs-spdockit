_**As of August 2nd, 2018, SPDocKit Online is deprecated, and its successor is**_ [_**SysKit Security Manager**_](https://www.syskit.com/products/security-manager/)_**.**_&lt;/br&gt; _**For instructions on the upgrade path or any other questions contact us at**_ [_**support@syskit.com**_](mailto:support@syskit.com)_**.**_

This article describes the Groups and Teams general report, as well as the report for each group in particular. The data on the main report that we provide about the Office 365 Groups and Teams are as follows: Display Name \(of the O365 group\), Email, Security Enabled \(False/True\), Visibility of the group \(Private/Public\), Proxy Addresses and Created On. Also, it describes available SPDocKit Management actions and wizards for Office 365 Groups and Teams.  
Additionally it provides information on our OneDrive report.

To start exploring features and reports navigate to Permission Explorer and select your tenant.

**Note!** Before you can start exploring Groups and Teams reports, SPDocKit will ask you to provide permissions for the following:

* **View your basic profile** \(allows the app to see your basic profile.     Name, picture, username\).
* **Access your data anytime** \(allows the app to see and update your data, even when you are not currently using the app\).
* **Sign in as you** \(allows you to sign into the app with your account and allows the app to read your basic profile information\).
* **Read directory data** \(allows the app to read data in your organization's directory\).
* **Read and write all groups** \(allows the app to create groups and read all group properties and memberships on your behalf. Additionally allows the app to manage your groups and to update group content for groups you are a member of\).
* **Read and write all users' full profiles** \(allows the app to read and write the full set of profile properties, reports, and managers of other users in your organization, on your behalf\).  

If you do not accept or do not have the right privileges **\(SharePoint Online Global Admin\)**, Groups and Teams set of features and reports will not be available.
