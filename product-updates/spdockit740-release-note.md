## Features

* New option available when you Grant the permissions directly. If you check the __Grant to everything in this list/folder, even to items with unique permission__, the principal will get the same permissions on all child objects.

* Added a new option to the Content Display Level filter - __Folder__. Now the folder level can be shown without the need to display the List Items. 


## Improvements

* Improved how the Content Display Level filter is set when you drill from Permissions Audit Overview to Permissions Audit Details report. The filter is now automatically set to List Items Level.

* Improved how the About SpDocKit section looks and feels - elements were centered, icons added and old buttons removed.


## Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue where the Compare Result window could not be accessed if the Compare Wizard main window was closed.

* Improved the visibility of filters on reports. Filters are now visible even when the opened report has no data to show. This way you can easily navigate to a farm or snapshot where the data is available and the report is generated. 

* Improved UX - Export and Save tab removed from Backstage.
